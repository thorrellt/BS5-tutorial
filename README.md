# Bootstrap 5 Tutorial Project

Welcome to my Bootstrap 5 Tutorial Project. This is written primarily in HTML & SASS using the Bootstrap 5 CSS Framework. This project served as my introduction to Bootstrap 5. I learned about several features and component offered by the framework including Cards, Accordions, Modals, Dropdowns and others. More importantly, I learned the basic syntax that is used in the Bootstrap framework, and how to read the documentation and implement the knowledge.

## Key Takeaways


**Syntax & Structure:** As this was my introduction into Bootstrap 5, the concept of designing a page primarily through HTML was foreign. This opened up a new way of thinking and organizing my code, however the simplicity of the framework when compared to the standard HTML & CSS combo is remarkable. 

**Components & Features:** Again, the simplicity and options provided by this framework offers so much potential. The options available, and their ease of implementation, make Bootstrap 5 a very viable option for more static webpages. 

**Bootstrap Icons:** The Bootstrap Icons Library is very useful, even if the rest of the framework is ignored. The CLI is very straightforward to include, and the option are robust for a large amount of basic icon needs. 

## If I Revisited This Project, 
#### I Would...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..update the color schemes using SASS. Currently the colors serve little purpose and are placed fairly randomly. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..add more interactive functionality via the inclusion of JavaScript to familiarize myself with the interactions between the DOM and Bootstrap 5.
